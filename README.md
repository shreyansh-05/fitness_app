# Approach Taken

We started the project by brainstorming what our models were going to be in order to reach MVP. After we had the models pinned down, we had a rough idea of the functionality we expected from the app.

Based on this, we divided up our tasks on Trello and assigned owners to each card.

### Functionality
1. **Plans** – Users can create a new 7 day exercise plan or adopt one from someone else in their tribe.

2. **Tracking** – Daily progress is tracked from the dashboard, successful completion of an exercise awards the user with grit points, based on time and intensity.

3. **Challenges** – Tribe-wide challenges can be found on the Tribe page and users can compete with other members by taking on these challenges.

4. **Insights** – The tribe page is rich with data visualisation which shows the tribe stats and how the user stacks up against it.

5. **Feed** – The feed shows a stream of updates and milestones from users on the app.

# Blockers
* **Model complexity:** We made extensive use of use subschemas and relational data, which proved to be fiddly at times. We had to be creative with how we approached our models and had to iterate our back end continuously. 

* **React norms:** Getting to grips with how React handles state updates and different levels of relationships between components was a major obstacle in the beginning. It took some getting used to and by day 3 we had a much better understanding.

# Wins
* **Deep interconnectedness:** Despite challenges, we managed to accomplish an intricate level of connection between all our individual pieces. 

* **Data driven:** Gathering rich data and using it to drive the experience was our focus from the very beginning. Good communication and planning with our models helped us achieve that.

# Future Features
* **Responsiveness:** Being riddled with bugs did not give us enough time to build a stable responsive version, this would be top priority as a future feature.

* **More with ‘following’:** While you can follow other users currently, we did not write any code to take advantage of that. In the future, I want to use that to provide more tailored experiences and exercise recommendations.

* **Better feed experience:** Our feed currently shows updates from all users on the platform, but in the future, it should show posts that are either from members of your tribe or people that you follow.
